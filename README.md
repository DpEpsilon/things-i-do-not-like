Things I Do Not Like
====================

This is a short list of things I do not like, and perhaps a few lines
about what I can conceivably do to mitigate the things I do not like
about them.

PostScript
----------

- Mostly the lack of convenient documentation, feature diffs between
  versions, and what different interpreters expect with regards to
  header and trailer data. I could start writing this myself.

Hex Editors
-----------

- I am too used to the feature-set of [ECS] HexEdit (which according
  to GitHub I have contributed to). The problem is this only runs on
  Windows, and there are some bit-level features missing.
- 010Editor is nice and has most of the features I would expect from a
  Hex Editor despite them lacking in other editors, but can be a bit
  clunky to use at times, has a fairly bloated template language, and
  has no source release.
- BinaryNinja is more of a disassembler, and also has no source
  release.
- All FOSS Hex Editors are pretty useless, except Radare2, which has a
  fairly steep learning curve and again, probably more of a
  disassembler.

- I am reluctant to write one myself, as I know ECS HexEdit was
  developed over many years of spare time and I'm not sure I can
  commit that.

LZW
---

- Relevant because it's used in PostScript
- Nobody seems to adhere to a standard format, and the format adhered
  to in any given scenario is not extremely likely to be
  documented. (It is for PostScript, however)
